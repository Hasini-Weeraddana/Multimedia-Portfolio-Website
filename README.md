## Description

This multimedia portfolio website is designed to highlight my projects using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features an index.html file as the main page, style.css for styling, app.js for interactivity, and additional files for the lightbox functionality.

The lightbox is implemented using the lightbox-plus-jquery.js library, providing a smooth and responsive experience when viewing images. The images for the portfolio are stored in the 'images' folder.

## Files Included

    • index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the website.
    • style.css: The CSS file containing styles for the entire website, ensuring a visually appealing layout.
    • app.js: JavaScript file responsible for interactive elements and dynamic behavior of the website.
